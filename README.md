Scripts to compare quantities between CAMB and CLASS

## Power spectrum

camb_vs_class_Pk.py compares the power spectrum (linear or nonlinear)  computed by the two codes (check description at the top of the file to see how to use it).

Status: currently observing a large discrepancy (uptp 5%) between CAMB and CLASS P(k) already at the linear level --> possible issues with the code which need to be fixed.
